What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?

I think the most interesting topic was the concept of network dissection, and assigning a natural language definition to an individual neuron within a Deep Neural Network.

Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.

In this project, I've been tasked to evaluate the performance of CLIP Dissect given several parameters. This would be done by comparing CLIP dissect's labels with a manually labeled neuron to see whether it is accurate. Due to the different argument combinations for CLIP dissect and the sheer amount of neurons, this is an extremely daunting task, having to lavel upwards of 40,000 neurons manually. Looking into a way to automate this process by using a ML model's capabilities is something that I would like to look into, such as using GPT4 or other vision models to evaluate the performance. Potentially looking into the effects of tuning individual neurons could also be something else to look into.

What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?

I think I need to be a lot more independent in putting in work to get the desired outcome for this quarter. I need to put in a lot more effort on my own proactively without relying on others directions in order to get the most out of this project.

What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?

I would like to experiment with training and tuning models on my own, and also would like to look into actually using the libraries for deep learning such as pytorch or tensorflow.
